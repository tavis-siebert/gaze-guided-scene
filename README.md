# Gaze-Guided Scene Graphs for Egocentric Action Prediction

A framework for building scene graphs from egocentric video using gaze data to predict future actions.

## Overview

This project builds scene graphs from egocentric video and gaze data to capture spatial and temporal relationships between objects, which can be used for action anticipation. The system:

1. Processes fixations and saccades to identify objects using CLIP
2. Constructs a scene graph with nodes (objects) and edges (transitions)
3. Extracts features at specified timestamps for downstream tasks
4. Provides interactive visualization of the graph construction process

Note: Refer to "Quick Start" section for instructions on how to visualize the graph construction process using the provided sample data.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Access to a Dropbox token for downloading the EGTEA Gaze+ dataset
- [uv package manager](https://astral.sh/uv) (setup scripts will install if not present)

### Quick Start

> **Note:** The graph visualization only requires the raw video file and corresponding trace file to be present, which we provide in `datasets/sample_data/`. All other steps, except for the environment setup, are optional.


1. **Setup environment**:
   Choose the appropriate setup script based on your environment:
   
   For Student Cluster:
   ```bash
   source scripts/setup_student_cluster_env.sh
   ```
   
   For Euler Cluster:
   ```bash
   source scripts/setup_euler_cluster_env.sh
   ```

   These scripts will:
   - Check if uv is installed, and install it if necessary
   - Ensure the proper Python version is available
   - Synchronize project dependencies using the lockfile (`uv sync`)

2. **Create a Dropbox token**:
   - Create an app at [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/)
   - Enable `sharing.read` permission
   - Generate an OAuth 2.0 token
   - Add to `.env` file: 
     ```
     # Dropbox token for dataset downloads
     DROPBOX_TOKEN=your_token_here
     
     # Optional: Custom config path
     CONFIG_PATH=path/to/your/config.yaml
     ```
   
   > **Note:** Dropbox tokens expire after a period of time. If you encounter authentication errors, you'll need to generate a new token following the steps above.

3. **Download dataset**:
   ```bash
   scripts/run.sh setup-scratch
   ```

4. **Build scene graphs**:
   ```bash
   scripts/run.sh build-graphs
   ```
   
   To enable tracing for visualization:
   ```bash
   scripts/run.sh build-graphs --videos VIDEO_NAME --enable-tracing
   ```

5. **Train a model**:
   ```bash
   scripts/run.sh train --task future_actions
   ```
   
   Or for next action prediction:
   ```bash
   scripts/run.sh train --task next_action
   ```

6. **Visualize graph construction**

   To visualize the graph construction process e.g. using the sample data:
   ```bash
   scripts/run.sh visualize --video-path datasets/sample_data/OP03-R02-TurkeySandwich.mp4 --trace-path datasets/sample_data/OP03-R02-TurkeySandwich_trace.jsonl
   ```

   The interactive dashboard should now be available at http://127.0.0.1:8050/
   

## Configuration System

The project uses YAML configuration files with a hierarchical structure:

```
base:                # Root directories
directories:         # Directory structure
dataset:             # Dataset settings and paths
  timestamps:        # Feature extraction timestamps
  egtea:             # EGTEA dataset paths
  ego_topo:          # Ego-topo data paths
  output:            # Output paths
models:              # Model settings
external:            # External resources
processing:          # Processing settings
trace_dir:           # Directory for graph construction trace files
```

**Key features**:
- Path references: `${path.to.reference}`
- Environment variables: `${USER}`, `${REPO_ROOT}`
- Configuration files: `student_cluster_config.yaml`, `euler_cluster_config.yaml`
- Environment variable `CONFIG_PATH` to specify configuration file path

## Environment Variables

The project supports configuration via environment variables in a `.env` file in the project root:

1. **Create a `.env` file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Available environment variables**:
   ```
   # Configuration file path
   CONFIG_PATH=path/to/your/config.yaml
   
   # Dropbox token for dataset downloads
   DROPBOX_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

Environment variables take precedence over defaults in the code. When specified, `CONFIG_PATH` 
determines which configuration file is loaded by default, but can still be overridden with the
`--config` command-line argument.

## Testing

### Running Tests Locally

To run tests locally (using mock models):

```bash
# Run all tests, automatically skipping those requiring real models
pytest tests/

# Run only unit tests
pytest tests/unit/

# Force run tests requiring real models
pytest --run-real-model tests/
```

### Running Tests on Cluster

For more resource-intensive tests, you can submit a job to the cluster:

```bash
# Submit test job to cluster
sbatch scripts/run_tests.sh
```

Test logs will be written to `logs/tests.out`.

## TensorBoard Integration

The project includes TensorBoard integration for visualizing training metrics and model performance. The logs are stored under `logs/{task}/` by default.

```bash
# Run training with TensorBoard logging
scripts/run.sh train --task next_action --device gpu

# Run training with TensorBoard logging
scripts/run.sh train --task future_actions --device gpu

# Launch TensorBoard to view metrics
tensorboard --logdir logs
```

## Command-Line Interface

```bash
scripts/run.sh [options] <command>
```

**Commands**:
- `setup-scratch`: Download and setup dataset
- `build-graphs`: Build scene graphs from videos
- `train`: Train a GNN on a specified task
- `visualize`: Visualize graph construction process

**Global Options**:
- `--config`: Path to custom config file
